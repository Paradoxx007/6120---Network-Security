What is Tor and onion service?
Internet users look for methods to anonymize their network data due to the growing privacy and security concerns. Tor system was created by pentagon as a research based project for absolute anonymity, which we now called Tor or onion service based on onion routing, to offer a comprehensive anonymous communication service [2]. The Naval Research Laboratory initially developed, implemented, and used Tor as a third-generation onion routing project. With more than 7000 different server sites scattered across the globe, it is the biggest anonymous communication network currently in use [3]. It carries terabytes of data each day and offers anonymous communication services to thousands of Internet users [4].
In the Information Age, it has evolved into an instrument for preserving freedom of speech and privacy [5]. The Tor Project has a negative reputation despite having good aims. The expansion of Tor and the anonymity it offers have made the network a haven for illegal activity known as the Dark Web, much like any big, growing city draws criminals [6]. A well-known illustration of a hidden service is Silk Road, a drug-selling website that the FBI took down in 2013 [5]. Ross Ulbricht, the site's administrator, was detained on suspicion of being "Dread Pirate Roberts," the site's fictitious founder, and he was given a life term.
What is onion routing/service?
The Tor network is built on a low-latency onion-routing architecture, where traffic is forwarded through arbitrarily chosen Onion Routers (ORs), encrypting data with numerous onion skins to preserve unlinkability [7]. 
In this situation, an OR can also be referred to as a relay, node, or simply a router. Each stream can be telescopically silently channelled through the network, which means that each router only knows the relays that come before and after it [8]. The source of the stream is only known to the first relay, the entry point. The only relay that is aware of the client's location is the last relay, the exit node. Only encrypted information is exchanged between the onion router(s) [9]. Symmetric cryptography is used to layer-encrypt data, which is then unwrapped by a relay before being forwarded to the following relay in the chain [104]. Typically, a circuit has three relays.

Attacks on Tor
The biggest network for anonymous contact is called Tor. Recent papers debate the efficacy of Tor and discuss the flaws in the Onion Router design. De-anonymizing attacks are increasingly utilising these weaknesses. The need for hybrid attacks that can be used at the network layer, protocol layer, or application layer has increased as attacks have become more complicated and potent over time. We'll talk about public Tor attacks and group them into categories for additional investigation. Some ethical flaws have also been created by Tor's freedom and privacy principles. The network's cover attracts criminal activity, which has damaged its image.
The majority of Tor assaults concentrate on figuring out which client and server are utilising the Tor network for communication [10]. De-anonymization is the procedure in question [11]. A circuit between the client and an exit node has been established in the Tor network, and the exit node is in communication with the host. A hidden service is being provided under a pseudonym, and the attacker wants to connect that pseudonym to the operator's real identity, either directly or through an intermediary step (such as a physical location or IP address) [12] [13]. The attacker also wants to confirm that the client and the server are communicating.
There are various categories of De-Anonymizing Techniques and Attacks namely –
Passive and active attacks and Single-end and end-to-end attacks
Attacks can be divided into seven categories according to their strategy and objective ->
Correlation Attacks End-to-end - Passive Attack
Congestion Attacks End-to-end - Active Attack
Timing Attacks End-to-end - Active Attack
Fingerprinting Attacks Single-end - Passive Attack [14]
Denial of Service Attacks Single-end - Active Attack
Supportive Attacks - Not classified.
Revealing Hidden Services Attacks Not classified
