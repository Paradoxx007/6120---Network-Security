The Onion Router, also known as TOR, is a free and open-source software program that routes internet traffic through a series of volunteer operated servers to provide anonymity and privacy to its users. The servers that are used are known as "nodes" or "relays." With the help of Tor, it becomes difficult for anyone to track a userâ€™s online activities. However, despite the security and privacy Tor provides, several attacks have taken place on Tor in recent years. In this paper, we discuss the different types of attacks that have been carried out, along with the strategy and motivation behind them. Further, an attack on Tor is implemented, and the vulnerable areas through which the Tor network can be compromised are analyzed.
